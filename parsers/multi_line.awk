#!/usr/bin/awk -f

# Usage: ./multi_line.awk -v start="START_PATTERN" -v end="END_PATTERN" input_file
#
# Prints everything between lines matching START_PATTERN and END_PATTERN.
# Checking for duplicates based on the second to last field (or last field if only one field exists).
#
# Usually multi line errors tend to look something like follows:
#
# ==================================================
# [ERROR] 2024-01-01 12:00:00 Some error occurred
# on trace id 12345
# maybe everything has crashed
# =================================================
#
# This script would print everything between the equal signs.
#
# If you have any other examples not covered by this script, please open an issue on GitHub.
